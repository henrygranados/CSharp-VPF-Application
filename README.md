# CSharp-VPF-Application

This is a simple C# WPF application. The purpose of this application is to collect coins from user and find the sum of all the coins. Once the sum of coins goes over or hits 30 then the jar is set to not accept any more coins. This application handles input from user. It also provides an awesome customized window(draggable window).
